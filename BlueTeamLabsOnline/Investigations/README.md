### Scenario

I'm Loner Varley, currently employed at Tech Innovator Inc., a cybersecurity start-up. Our company's name may sound a bit whimsical, but our primary mission is to safeguard businesses from cyber threats and ensure their continuous operation. Ironically, we've recently faced allegations of security breaches. Yes, it's quite ironic for a cybersecurity provider to fall victim to hacking; it almost feels worse than the reputation of LastPass. We're certainly going through some challenging times, and sometimes it feels like we're haunted by these incidents. I've become quite vigilant about our situation.

In my role as a Junior Forensics Analyst, I've observed some peculiar behavior from my colleague, Katy Tilf, who is an integral part of our two-person team. Lately, she's been falling behind on her workload and missing important meetings, which is quite uncharacteristic of her. This situation has placed additional pressure on me, making me feel like I'm cleaning up after her, much like a janitor. What's more frustrating is that our manager doesn't seem to care much about her deteriorating performance, and this is on top of the already less-than-ideal circumstances at our start-up. It's becoming increasingly exhausting for me to deal with this situation.

I've noticed that Katy is spending a lot of time using her Outlook email client. During a moment of curiosity, I observed her engaged in an extended email conversation with someone named Brody on her work PC. The strange thing is that Brody doesn't work for our company, nor is he a client. Seizing an opportunity when Katy was away from her desk, I discreetly downloaded a copy of this email conversation. I'm determined to uncover the truth behind her actions and get to the bottom of this mystery.
