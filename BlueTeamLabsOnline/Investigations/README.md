Completed **Blue Team Labs Online** investigations pertaining to threat intelligence.

## YUREI

### Scenario

I'm Loner Varley, currently employed at Tech Innovator Inc., a cybersecurity start-up. Our company's name may sound a bit whimsical, but our primary mission is to safeguard businesses from cyber threats and ensure their continuous operation. Ironically, we've recently faced allegations of security breaches. Yes, it's quite ironic for a cybersecurity provider to fall victim to hacking; it almost feels worse than the reputation of LastPass. We're certainly going through some challenging times, and sometimes it feels like we're haunted by these incidents. I've become quite vigilant about our situation.

In my role as a Junior Forensics Analyst, I've observed some peculiar behavior from my colleague, Katy Tilf, who is an integral part of our two-person team. Lately, she's been falling behind on her workload and missing important meetings, which is quite uncharacteristic of her. This situation has placed additional pressure on me, making me feel like I'm cleaning up after her, much like a janitor. What's more frustrating is that our manager doesn't seem to care much about her deteriorating performance, and this is on top of the already less-than-ideal circumstances at our start-up. It's becoming increasingly exhausting for me to deal with this situation.

I've noticed that Katy is spending a lot of time using her Outlook email client. During a moment of curiosity, I observed her engaged in an extended email conversation with someone named Brody on her work PC. The strange thing is that Brody doesn't work for our company, nor is he a client. Seizing an opportunity when Katy was away from her desk, I discreetly downloaded a copy of this email conversation. I'm determined to uncover the truth behind her actions and get to the bottom of this mystery.

## DERAILED

### Scenario

 My name is Eriphyle. I am an artist by trade, but I love to dabble in cybersecurity-ish stuff outside of work. My mother kindled my interest, to be frank. As a female, I get worried that I can never break this male-dominated field—regardless, I am still going to try anyway.

I was born and raised in Poland. My father and I recently moved to a place called “Winter Wonderland.” It is much colder than in my home country, but my father was able to find work there as a Train Engineer. Ever since Mother passed, money has been tight—luckily this job pays six figures. But, that tragic day changed everything.

Mysterious saboteurs—dubbed “Glacier”—have, over the past year, disrupted Wonderland's railway system—a major piece of transit infrastructure for our city, serving as a key resource in the growth of our economy. On December 15th, Wonderland’s train—carrying both freight and passengers—was brought to a halt across the land; my father happened to be working that day, and passengers, during an abrupt stop. The disruption of the railway lines caused much chaos: the delay of medical supplies, raw materials, and public transportation are a few. If this persists, we won’t have a thriving economy anymore, this land was built for railroads!

I lost my mother already. I am not losing my father because of some radical hackers who could give a damn about human life. Father is aware of my interest in cybersecurity, so he referred me to his employer’s cybersecurity department, which is quite small at the moment. Thankfully—due to this tragic incident—I am currently working with some cybersecurity professionals for the first time in my life to examine this issue. I still ponder “why” I was accepted. Well, Wonderland currently lacks cybersecurity professionals, so my “expertise” is needed at a time like this. I guess it helps to have a portfolio—a cyber-artistic one mind you.

I am going to get to the bottom of this. It is time to bring the heat to “Glacier!”
